What is statefull architecture? 

In this type of architecture server will store session data of user, so it provides better experience for user.

But it have major drawback . Can you guess what that be

Problem is that , when user go to site, there may be chances that he get redirected to another server of architecture, where his data was not stored.
Or maybe if we want to horizontally scale up, we have same user data in many servers, resources wastage.

So, use stateless once
